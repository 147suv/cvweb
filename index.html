      A hard-working enthusiastic individual with national diploma (ND) in mass communication and rich experience as a Secretary/sales recipient (3 years) and also 
      These job experience has equipped me with a great deal of technical skills, as well as important soft skills like leadership, responsibility and
      organization skills. As a sales recipient, I developed the ability to interact effectively and with respect in order to try meeting their
      needs through understanding and managing their unique differences. 
      I have excellent interpersonal skills, team spirit, empowerment abilities, and I find it particularly important to be able to dedicate myself fully. I am currently 
      looking for an opportunity to prove my value in the local Labor market.
